# CSC492 Semester Long Project
Final project repository for CSC 492 group of Nick, Sabah, Brennan and Ruifang.

## Overview
This application is written in Flask, a web development framework written in Python. It uses virtual environments for package management.

## Setup 
To get access to the code, navigate to the directory on your local machine in which you want the code/repo to be stored, and run: ```$ git clone https://github.com/Brennan-Richards/csc-492-project.git```. You can then create branches, add files, push back to the repository, etc.

## Running
To run the application, first the virtual environment must be active. To activate the virtual environment, navigate to the code repository via a terminal on your local machine and run: ```$ . venv/bin/activate```. The Flask application can then be run on a local server for development by running: ```$ flask run```.
