         <h5>Problem</h5>
         <p>
          1. Provide people suffering with epilepsy a resource purposed to help them learn about their condition, 
          lower stress induced by epilepsy and destigmatize the condition<br>
          2. Common emotional challenges that face people with the disease.
         </p>

         <h5>Task</h5>
         <p>
          1. Self-evaluation of emotional wellbeing. <br>
          2. Consume course content. <br>
          3. View progress over time via dashboard. <br>
         </p>

         <h5>Questions for Interview</h5>
         <p>
            1. What is your experience related to epilepsy? <br>
	    2. How do you feel about the rating process? (Ask after sign in/sign up and rating) <br>
	    3. How do you feel about the video content? (After asking them to go to breakout room and watch content for ~5-10 minutes) <br>
	    4. What other areas have you known epilepsy patients to struggle in, which our application does not cover? <br>
	    5. Was there anything that stuck out to you about the platform? <br>
            6. What features would you build into a web application to augment your own work? <br>
            7. Do you know anyone else connected to epilepsy that you’d be willing to put us in touch with? <br>
            8. Any general UI issues? <br>
         </p>

         <h5>Session observations</h5>
	 <h6> <strong>P1 </strong></h6>
         <p> 
	     1. URI professor whose research is on biomedical devices for treating/reducing seizures. <br>
             2. <strong>Main takeaway: </strong> epilepsy’s emotional consequences are directly related to the brain region where seizures take hold.<br>
         </p>

	 <h6><strong>P2 </strong></h6>
         <p>
	      1. Elementary school nurse currently dealing with a number of students who have epilepsy.<br>
              2. Best friend from high school was epileptic.<br>
              3. <strong>Main takeaway: </strong> young children don’t know yet that they “should” be embarrassed about their conditions.<br>
         </p>

	 <h6><strong>P3 </strong></h6>
         <p>
	      1. Head nurse of a MA school district. <br>
	      2. Works with a number of students w/ epilepsy, especially epilepsy + special needs. <br>
              3. <strong>Main takeaway: </strong> has noticed with students that hormonal changes and sleep patterns have changed seizure frequency.<br>

         <h5>High-level reflections</h5>
         <p>
            1. Expertise in the source of the content. <br>
	    2. Test the application multiple times to make sure it works every time. <br>
	    3. The idea should be more comprehensive（users’ personal information, learning styles). <br>
	    4. Give slightly less background information about the application so that when users interact with the 
               website, they are operating out of instinct offering a more authentic user test<br>
         </p>
