         <h5>Scenarios</h5>
         <h6>Karen's Social Life</h6>
         <p>Problem: Karen(20) is an extroverted young adult who enjoys people's company, but is faced with anxiety/fear and stigmatization due to her epilepsy. Despite her having epilepsy, she still
            makes a strong effort to engage with her friends and not let her epilepsy hold her back. Her worst
            fears are realized one night at a party when a seizure takes hold of her. While her body uncontrollably feels the seizure, people gawk and laugh at her. Many bystanders do not understand her 
            condition, and those who do insensitively react to her seizure. After this poor experience, Karen has
            trouble coping, and moving on from the event, or engaging in future social interactions due to embarrassment/fear. Karen starts searching out
            online resources to help with her emotional problems from epilepsy and finds our application. The applicatioin determines that Karen would benefit most from the
            'take another look' module. After completing the 'take another look' module, Karen realizes that her problem will not disappear, but she
            figures out that she can find a way to shed a positive light upon it. Karen searches for a positive way to frame the problem and realizes she is hanging out
            with the wrong people, and should reconvene with her less popular friends that accept and support Karen for who she is.
         </p>
         <h6>Dan's Work</h6>
         <p>Dan, a 30 year old male, battles with his anxiety daily, struggling to get out of bed and go to work with a looming fear over his head. 
            Will my employer find out about my epilepsy? Will they fire me because they think I am a risk? Despite his constant stress, Dan has managed to float by so far 
            but has not established a stable life for himself yet. After being let go at his last job, it was not easy to just find a job but also to build up self 
            confidence to start searching for one in the first place. Though he lives in an urban area and job opportunities are seemingly endless, he is unable to bring 
            himself to try. It is people like Dan who lack direction and guidance to overcome the daily challenges epilepsy poses, in regards not to just social life but 
            also work life. 
              Dan finds our application through a online community of people living with epilepsy. It  designed to educate people with epilepsy to give them 
            the tools to take control of their life. Dan began to use the program and after an initial set of questions was recommended a starting point to begin his support. 
            He completes many of the stress control exercises like breathing techniques allowing him to curb anxiety attacks before they are able to take hold. He was able to 
            watch helpful techniques in properly explaining his epileptic condition when necessary, and encountered abundant positive reinforcement encouraging him to recognize 
            his condition but not let it hold him back from living how he truly wanted. Within a few weeks of his support through our application, he manages to set up a job 
            interview with a local company and feels confident he can land the job.
</p>
         <h6>Hank's Relationship</h6>
         <p>Hank (43) is a middle aged male with epilepsy who is having trouble maintaining a relationship with his wife Mary(41). Hank is a passionate person and in an ideal 
            world would take his partner on many adventurous trips to explore nature together. He dreams of going on hikes, paddling a canoe and of taking Mary on exotic 
            vacations where they could walk beaches together away from the hustle and bustle of their city life in Boston. Unfortunately Hank feels true fear when he opens 
            his laptop to look into planning a trip, it seems at every step of the process his mind runs with countless fears that result in him being unable to end up booking 
            anything at all. Mary and him have enjoyed the last two years married together but Hank worries that Mary will only entertain the same “dinner at home” date night 
            for so long before she grows tired of the same thing over and over again. He has made up his mind that unless he is able to show off his spontaneous and fun side, 
            his time with his wife will be far shorter than he wishes. He feels that epilepsy only allows him to be half the man he is in his mind.
              By chance while searching for epilepsy friendly vacations, he finds our application built for people like him. He realizes after completing training modules that 
            his epilepsy does not need to hold him back from exploring the world with the woman he loves. He engages with many exercises designed to break the mental stigma 
            people suffering with epilepsy have about themselves. By breaking the stigma in Hank’s mind, he is able to build up the confidence and trust in himself to take Mary 
            on a trip she will never forget.
