         <h5>Epilepsy Patient (Target User) Motifs</h5>
         <ul>
           <li>Social isolation due to stigma from their disease</li>
           <li>Trouble finding employment -- also due to stigmatization</li>
           <li>Intensely anxiety-inducing side-effects such as sudden unexpected death in 1% of patients</li>
           <li>Harsh treatments for stubborn cases</li>
         </ul>
         <h5>Personas</h5>
         <img class="persona" src="user-persona-karen.png" /><br>
         <img class="persona" src="user-persona-dan.png" />
         <img class="persona" src="hank-user-persona.png" />

         <h5>Scenarios</h5>
         <h6>Karen's Social Life</h6>
         <p>Problem: Karen is an extrovert who enjoys people's company, but is faced with anxiety/fear and stigmatization due to her epilepsy. Her worst
            fears are realized one night at a party when a seizure takes hold of her, people gawk and laugh. After the experience, Karen has
            trouble coping, and moving on from the event, or engaging in future social interactions due to embarassment/fear.</p>
         <h6>Dan's Work</h6>
         <p>Dan has trouble maintaining consistent employment. His past employers have let Dan go for reasons that seem related to his condition, 
            whether they openly admit it or not. Dan has neglected to tell his current workplace peers and employer about his condition for fear
            of facing the same fate. Dan faces anxiety over the possibility of having a seizure at work and losing his job. Dan could benefit from
            taking a step back from his current situation and re-assessing whether his relationship with his workplace is healthy or not.</p>
         <h6>Hank's Relationship</h6>
         <p>Hank has extreme anxiety due to his feelings of inadequacy, and lack of self confidence caused by his epilepsy. Dan has social anxiety
            and feels like he is restricted from being adventurous with his partner (travel, spontaneous events) because he is medically liable.
            Hank suffers from a common stigma that his epilepsy is disabling. </p>
         <h5>Use Case</h5>
          <h6>New proposal <span class="text-muted">(B.R.)</span></h6>
          <p><em>User</em> refers to a patient suffering from epilepsy, and expreriencing negative fallout from their condition</p>
          <ol>
             <li>The customer arrives on the product's landing page</li>
             <li>The product asks the users a series of questions for uncovering what pains them about their epilepsy</li>
             </li>The user answers those questions</li>
             <li>The product determines what the user suffers with from a list of four categories of emotional problems that commonly pose a problem to
                 epilepsy patients: problem solving, taking a second look, recognizing stigma, and stress management</li>
             <li>The user is presented a series of content (a "course") by professional epilepsy physicians related to the area that harms them most
                 (from the above step), interspersed with activities which are designed to provide checkpoints to the user as to how they are
                 progressing along their journey to emotional stability</li>
             <li>The user grows emotionally and takes this knowledge back into their daily lives, where they can use it to overcome their emotional roadblocks
                 that face them in their daily lives.</li>
         </ol>
          <h6>Old</h6>
          <ol>
             <li>In all cases, the target users can go to the website and browse the content from four categories: problem solving, taking a second look,
             recognizing stigma, and stress management -- four areas that commonly plague epilepsy patients.</li>
             <li>The patient gets a broad overview of each of the
               four sections </li>
             <li>The patient makes a choice to dive deeper into a section to start with, and rate their own feelings/position at the outset before watching
                 video contents from each module in-depth and complete the corresponding exercises.</li>
             <li>Ideally, the patient will come away with a better understanding of the facts associated with their condition, and
               they should have a resource in the web application to return to for future help.</li>
         </ol>
         <h5>Requirements</h5>
         <ol>
             <li>(Data) The patient must enter their rating of their feelings on a scale of negative to positive valence in regards to the topic of each
                  module at the outset and end of that module.</li>
             <li>(Technical) The technology must be able to run in a web browser environment on mobile or desktop.</li>
             <li>(Functional) The website can track a patient's emotional progress as they accomplish subsequent sections of the web application.</li>
             <li>(Environment) The web application must be of soothing color, not too flashy or animated in order to avoid triggering seizures.</li>
         </ol>
