         <h5>Epilepsy Patient (Target User) Motifs</h5>
         <ul>
           <li>Social isolation due to stigma from their disease</li>
           <li>Trouble finding employment -- also due to stigmatization</li>
           <li>Intensely anxiety-inducing side-effects such as sudden unexpected death in 1% of patients</li>
           <li>Harsh treatments for stubborn cases</li>
         </ul>
         <h5>Personas</h5>
         <img class="persona" src="user-persona-karen.png" /><br>
         <img class="persona" src="user-persona-dan.png" />
         <img class="persona" src="hank-user-persona.png" />

         <h5>Scenarios</h5>
         <h6>Karen's Social Life</h6>
         <p>Problem: Karen(20) is extroverted young adult who enjoys people's company, but is faced with anxiety/fear and stigmatization due to her epilepsy. Despite her having epilepsy, she still
            makes a strong effort to engage with her friends and not let her epilepsy hold her back. Her worst
            fears are realized one night at a party when a seizure takes hold of her. While her body uncrontrollably feels the seizure, people gawk and laugh at her. Many bystanders do not understand her 
            condition, and those who do insensitively react to her seizure. After the this poor experience, Karen has
            trouble coping, and moving on from the event, or engaging in future social interactions due to embarassment/fear. Karen starts searching out
            online resources to help with her emotional problems from epilepsy and finds our application. After going through the educational 
            resources there, Karen feels well equipped with skills to better handle herself emotionally. More info.</p>
         <h6>Dan's Work</h6>
         <p>Dan has trouble maintaining consistent employment. His past employers have let Dan go for reasons that seem related to his condition, 
            whether they openly admit it or not. Dan has neglected to tell his current workplace peers and employer about his condition for fear
            of facing the same fate. Dan faces anxiety over the possibility of having a seizure at work and losing his job. Dan could benefit from
            taking a step back from his current situation and re-assessing whether his relationship with his workplace is healthy or not.</p>
         <h6>Hank's Relationship</h6>
         <p>Hank has extreme anxiety due to his feelings of inadequacy, and lack of self confidence caused by his epilepsy. Dan has social anxiety
            and feels like he is restricted from being adventurous with his partner (travel, spontaneous events) because he is medically liable.
            Hank suffers from a common stigma that his epilepsy is disabling. </p>
         <h5>Use Case</h5>
          <h6>New proposal</h6>
          <p><em>User</em> refers to a patient suffering from epilepsy, and experiencing negative emotional consequences from their condition. <em>Product</em> 
             refers to the team's web application for emotionally educating and skilling the user.</p>
          <b>Normal course [under normal circumstances what will the user do?]</b>
          <ol>
             <li>The customer arrives on the product's landing page.</li>
             <li>The user creates an account, or sign into their existing account.</li>
             <li>The product asks the users to rank themselves on four categories of emotional problems that commonly pose a problem to
                 epilepsy patients: <em>problem solving, taking a second look, recognizing stigma, and stress management<em> (how do you feel about ____) in order to uncover
                 what pains them about their epilepsy.</li>
             <li>The user answers those questions.</li>
             <li>The product determines what the user suffers with most out of the four categories.</li>
             <li>The user is presented a series of content (a "course") by professional epilepsy physicians related to the area that harms them most
                 (from the above step), interspersed with activities and checkpoints for the user to see how they are progressing along their journey to emotional 
                 stability. Patients rate themselves on their emotional valence on a continuous scale.</li>
             <li>The user makes significant emotional progress (their end scores are more positive than their beginning scores) and their quality of life improves.</li>
             <li>The user takes knowledge and skills back into their daily lives, where they can use it to overcome their emotional roadblocks
                 that face them in their daily lives.</li>
          </ol>
          <b>Alternate course(s) [what happens if the user does not take the expected course?]</b>
          <ol start="7">
            <li>If the user has not made significant emotional progress, they desire to grow further in other areas:
              <ol>
                <li>The product reccomends the course it decides that the user is the second most likely to benefit from.</li>
                <li>The user starts again from step #5</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <!-- <h6>Old</h6>
          <ol>
             <li>In all cases, the target users can go to the website and browse the content from four categories: problem solving, taking a second look,
             recognizing stigma, and stress management -- four areas that commonly plague epilepsy patients.</li>
             <li>The patient gets a broad overview of each of the
               four sections </li>
             <li>The patient makes a choice to dive deeper into a section to start with, and rate their own feelings/position at the outset before watching
                 video contents from each module in-depth and complete the corresponding exercises.</li>
             <li>Ideally, the patient will come away with a better understanding of the facts associated with their condition, and
               they should have a resource in the web application to return to for future help.</li>
         </ol> -->
         <h5>Requirements</h5>
         <ol>
             <li>(Data) Patients' information should be kept securely due to the sensitive nature.</li>
             <li>(Data) The patient must enter their rating of their feelings on a scale of negative to positive valence in regards to the topic of each
                  module at the outset and end of that module.</li>
             <li>(Technical) The technology must be able to run in a web browser environment on mobile or desktop.</li>
             <li>(Functional) The website can track a patient's emotional progress as they accomplish subsequent sections of the web application.</li>
             <li>(Environment) The web application must be of soothing color, not too flashy or animated in order to avoid triggering seizures.</li>
